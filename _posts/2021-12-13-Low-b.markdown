# Question:
I3 has no native support for low battery warning. Your task is
- Write a script for i3 that
- Warns the user with a message when the battery power goes below 7%. 
- Discuss the relevant part of the i3config file.

## Solution

Here is the bash script:

~~~console
#!/bin/bash
file="/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0"
cap=$(cat "$file/capacity")
while [[ $cap -ge 7 ]];
 do
 cap=$(cat "$file/capacity")
 done
if [[ $cap -le 7 ]]; then
     notify-send \
    "Low Battery" \
    "Your battery is $cap that is  below 7% " 
fi
~~~


This script takes the information and update the status of battery till it reaches at the conclusion that it is less than 7% and gives the notification.

Here is the relevant part of config file:

>#checking low battery levels
>#the script will run from the startup and keep running , as soon as battery is below 7% it will show the warning
>>exec_always bash ~/Documents/CS100/a5/q10/q10.sh
